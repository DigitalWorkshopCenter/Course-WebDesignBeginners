              When you start working with JavaScript you’ll soon see
              references to things called JavaScript frameworks. Whether these

              a framework?
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to answer this burning question, we’re providing you
              with a newbie-proof definition of what JS frameworks actually
              are.
            </p>
            <h2>What is a JavaScript Framework?</h2>
            <p>
              Think of building websites and web apps like building a
              house—when you set out to build a house, you could create all of
              your own building materials from scratch and start building
              without any schematics, but that approach would be incredibly
              time-consuming and doesn’t make a lot of sense. It’s more likely
              that you would purchase pre-manufactured building materials
              (wood, bricks, countertops, etc.) and then assemble them based
              on a blueprint to fit your specific needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coding is very similar. When you set out to code a website, you
              could code every aspect of that site from scratch, but there are
              certain common website features that make more sense to apply
              from a template—if you need a wheel, for instance, it’s a lot
              more sensible to buy one than it is to reinvent it. And that’s
              where JavaScript frameworks come into play.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                At their most basic, JS frameworks are collections of
                JavaScript code libraries (see below) that provide developers
                with pre-written JS code to use for routine programming
                features and tasks—literally a framework to build websites or
                web applications around.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              If you need a standard JavaScript photo carousel on a webpage,
              for instance, you can use code from a framework to provide the
              feature for you (while you spend more time on coding the unique
              aspects of your site that don’t have an easy, plugin solution).
              If you’ve heard of the singular JavaScript library jQuery, this
              might sound familiar, but there’s a small (yet important)
              distinction when it comes to singular JavaScript libraries
              versus JavaScript frameworks.
            </p>
            <h2>jQuery and JavaScript Libraries</h2>
            <p>
              <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/what-is-jquery-used-for/">JS libraries like jQuery</a>
              are used by plugging library code into the rest of your site’s
              code when needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want to use a jQuery template for an autocomplete
              feature, for instance, you would insert the appropriate jQuery
              code, which then retrieves the feature from the jQuery library
              and displays it on your user’s web browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              In other words, when a front-end developer uses a library like
              jQuery, the developer is using jQuery code to “call” the jQuery
              library, which then provides the requested content.
            </p>
            <h2>
              What Makes JavaScript Frameworks Different From Libraries?
            </h2>
            <p>
              When you&#8217;re trying to define framework in the context of
              library vs framework, think of it like this: when you use JS
              frameworks the process is more holistic—a framework doesn’t just
              offer an individual solution to a coding problem, it provides a
              structure (like a skeleton or a scaffolding&#8230;or a
              framework) that organizes the parts of your site where the
              framework is implemented.
            </p>
            <p>
              This structure comes via page templates with areas set aside for
              code from the framework’s libraries (which the JavaScript
              framework “calls” on its own).
            </p>
            <p>
              The upside to using JavaScript frameworks is the overall
              efficiency and organization that they bring to a project—your
              code will be neatly structured, and the framework will provide
              readymade solutions for common coding problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, all of that structure can be the downside of
              working with a framework—any JavaScript code you write on top of
              JS frameworks needs to follow rules and conventions specific to
              the framework, limiting the freedom you have when coding
              entirely by hand.
            </p>
            <h2>Are JavaScript Frameworks an All or Nothing Solution?</h2>
            <p>
              With those limitations in mind, does using JavaScript frameworks
              mean the framework structure has to be applied your entire site?
            </p>
            <p>It depends.</p>
            <p>
              While some frameworks are designed to live underneath all of
              your site or web app’s code, other frameworks—like the
              increasingly popular Vue (see below)—allow for incremental use.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means you can apply the framework to as much or as little
              of your website or web app as you want. As more frameworks have
              adopted this incremental model, JS frameworks have become an
              increasingly flexible way to provide structure when appropriate,
              while still giving front-end developers the freedom to hand-code
              when necessary.
            </p>
            <h2>Where to Now?</h2>
            <p>
              Now that you understand a bit of what JavaScript Frameworks are,
              it is time to get introduced to some of them. There are many,
              and they are always evolving — adapting to present needs, and
              competing with one another to meet the highest demand in the
              market. This is great because web developers can rely on the
              fact that these frameworks will continue to grow in efficiency
              and in their product offerings. With that said, they are always
              changing, so developers have to do the work to stay up to speed
              with the latest trends and changes. The following frameworks are
              the most widely used and most popular as of

            <h4>Declarative</h4>
            <p>
              React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple
              views for each state in your application, and React will
              efficiently update and render just the right components when
              your data changes. Declarative views make your code more
              predictable and easier to debug.
            </p>
            <h4>Component-Based</h4>
            <p>
              Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then
              compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is
              written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass
              rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

            <h2>What is Vue.js?</h2>
            <p>
              Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework
              for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic
              frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be
              incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view
              layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other
              libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also
              perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page
              Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and
              supporting libraries.

            <h2>Why Use Ember?</h2>
            <p>
              From the
              <a href="https://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">homepage</a> of
              Ember's site, they market their product as follows:
            </p>
            <h4>A Framework for ambitious web developers</h4>
            <p>
              Ember.js is a productive, battle-tested JavaScript framework for
              building modern web applications. It includes everything you
              need to build rich UIs that work on any device.
            </p>
            <h4>Build with the teams that never stop shipping.</h4>
            <p>
              Some of the best development teams in the world have been
              iterating on their products for years with Ember. With scalable
              UI architecture baked-in from the start, you'll be working with
              the same patterns these organizations use every step of the way.
            </p>
            <h4>Batteries are included</h4>
            <p>
              Ember’s out-of-the-box experience has everything you need to
              start building on day one and keep shipping for years. Benefit
              from our years of experience to help your team be
              productive—faster. You'll never have to wire together your own
              framework ever again!
            </p>
            <h4>Build pipeline</h4>
            <p>
              Ember CLI is the backbone of modern Ember apps, providing code
              generators to create new entities and putting the necessary
              files in the right place, every time. Ember apps come with a
              built-in development environment with fast rebuilds,
              auto-reload, and a test runner! Ready to deploy? That's easy,
              too— build your app for production with a single command.
            </p>
            <h4>Routing</h4>
            <p>
              The URL has always been one of the major strengths of the web,
              and Ember apps respect that. Ember's built-in router is a
              best-in-class solution that incorporates async data loading with
              dynamic url segments and query parameters. The Ember router
              seamlessly supports nested urls with incremental data fetching,
              nested loading, and error substates.
            </p>
            <h4>Data layer</h4>
            <p>
              While you can use any data layer for your app, every new Ember
              app includes a fully-featured data access library called Ember
              Data. Ember Data allows you to access data across multiple
              sources at once, setup asynchronous relationships, and keep
              models up-to-date across your app.
            </p>
            <h4>Testing</h4>
            <p>
              Enjoy a fully-featured, modern test harness built into every
              application by default. Every time an entity is generated in an
              Ember app, tests are also generated for that same entity. Ember
              apps support three levels of testing that are handy for testing
              everything from individual components to acceptance tests that
              can boot your whole app and interact with it to verify
              everything is working as it should be. Tests are also run in the
              browser, providing that extra peace of mind.
            </p>
            <h4>Performance</h4>
            <p>
              Ember is built on the Glimmer rendering engine, one of the
              fastest rendering technologies on the market today, thanks to
              the way it compiles templates down to a highly-performant
              virtual machine. Due to our holistic performance approach,
              performance upgrades are often free with version upgrades— no
              extra work necessary!

            <h2>What is NodeJS</h2>
            <p>
              Node.js: Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime
              environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser. You
              need to remember that NodeJS is not a framework and it’s not a
              programming language. Most people are confused and understand
              it’s a framework or a programming language. We often use Node.js
              for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile
              App.
            </p>

            <p>
              Features of Node.js: There are other programming languages also
              which we can use to build back-end services so what makes
              Node.js different I am going to explain.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>

                  It’s easy to get started and can be used for prototyping and

              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Why Use Node?</h2>
            <p>
              From the
              <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about/" target="_blank">about page</a>
              of Node's site, they explain:
            </p>
            <p>
              As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is
              designed to build scalable network applications. In the
              following "hello world" example, many connections can be handled
              concurrently. Upon each connection, the callback is fired, but
              if there is no work to be done, Node.js will sleep.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="js">
  const http = require('http');

  const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
  const port = 3000;
  
  const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello World');
  });
  
  server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
  });
              </code></pre>
            <p>
              This is in contrast to today's more common concurrency model, in
              which OS threads are employed. Thread-based networking is
              relatively inefficient and very difficult to use. Furthermore,
              users of Node.js are free from worries of dead-locking the
              process, since there are no locks. Almost no function in Node.js
              directly performs I/O, so the process never blocks. Because
              nothing blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop
              in Node.js.

              When deciding which framework to use when developing an
              application, there are several things to take into account. Some
              of them are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Availability of Learning Resources</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Popularity</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Core Features</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Usability</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Ease of Integration (with other libraries)</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Startup Cost (Learning Curve)</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Maintainability</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Oftentimes, developers will want to learn something that will be
              marketable, and they don't really have an application need when
              they want to start. So they will see features offered by various
              frameworks and have no basis of what matters most because they
              don't have an application to apply it to. In these cases, there
              are few things to take into consideration when finding the
              framework(s) that will most likely yield the best benefit.

                  Search Indeed.com for jobs for each framework. Notice the
                  following three things: How many jobs there are, How much
                  they pay, How much experience is required. The following
                  stats were all gathered on the same day.

              we can see the most popular of these frameworks being compared
              in how much they are searched for on the web, and how many jobs
              there are. You will see, this is very similar to the indeed.com
              search results from a moment ago.

              Along with this, it is often helpful to search Google for
              JavaScript Framework Market Share to see current data of what is
              being used.

              is an article from 2020 that compares these frameworks and talks
              about which ones are trending. One interesting comment from this
              article was:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code class="quote">It may be cool to learn Svelte or Vue — but if your goal is
                  to get a job, you’ll have better odds if you learn React
                  first.</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              After looking at our search results from Indeed.com, this makes
              sense completely.

              However, this does not mean that React is the best. They all
              serve a different purpose, but there is no denying that React is
              being used more than any of the others. The topics mentioned
              above are important when considering which to use for a specific
              project. These frameworks can all pay very well, but as this
              question has been asked time and time again:
              <code>Which framework will be the best for my project?</code>,
              React has ended up on top. For this purpose, we will spend the
              remainder of this course learning JavaScript concepts in a React
              environment, and learning React for application development.
