            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>In this section, we will learn about how to make JavaScript run code asynchronously. We have already learned about callbacks, and we heard about promises and async await in the last lesson when discussing mock data. In this lesson, we will dive a little deeper into promises and what they are, as well as how to use async / await to utilizes promises efficiently.</p>
            <h4>Promises</h4>
            <h5>What is a promise?</h5>
            <p>From the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise" target="_blank">Mozilla Website</a>, we learn that t fhe Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_promise.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> has a lot of good information on this.</p>
            <h4>Async / Await</h4>
            <p><a href="https://javascript.info/async-await" target="_blank">This</a> article articulates the use of async / await very well.</p>

            <h2>Where to Deploy?</h2>
            <p>There are a lot of different hosts that you can choose from. Oftentimes you can purchase a domain and hosting from the same website. A lot of hosting providers will let you host for free if you use a domain of theirs. For example, my <a href="nathanbirch.netlify.app" target="_blank">Professional Portfolio</a> is hosted with netlify for free as a subdomain of the netlify domain. Several companies do something very similar. </p>
            <p>You should be aware that not all hosts can host all projects. For example, I once tried to host a Node.js application with GoDaddy, and it was absolutely terrible. They are made to work with PHP and after a lot of pain, the company I was working for ended up having to use a different host. So before you choose a host for your project, make sure that they can support the technologies that you are going to deploy. </p>
            <p>The options listed here work with React websites (for the most part). A lot of people like Github Pages because of how closely linked to their Github account it is. But I found that after deploying my React app to Github Pages, there was some funky behavior because Github Pages isn't made to host technologies like React. Netlify, Heroku and Surge (also listed below) are great alternatives, and they have free options as well. And, all three of these can connect to your Github account, and you can set it up so that if you push to your main/master branch on Github, it will do a build and update your production website. It's pretty awesome!</p>
            <p>With that, let's go ahead and dive in to how to deploy our projects to these different hosts.</p>

            <h4>What is a professional portfolio?</h4>
            <p>A portfolio is a way to document your professional journey and demonstrate your skills and abilities. It can be a collection of your work and accomplishments in either a physical or digital format.</p>
            <p>A resume and cover letter are standard requirements for most job applications, but a professional portfolio is something that can help you stand out from other candidates. You can submit a portfolio with your job application, and you can also offer it during a first interview to give employers an in-depth and tangible summary of your best accomplishments.</p>
            <h4>Why do I need one?</h4>
            <p>In the Web Development and Software Engineering Industry, having a professional portfolio is of paramount importance. Most job applications online will require to include a link to your github profile, or a professional portfolio because employers want to see what you are capable of and what you've been able to accomplish.</p>
            <p>You should think of creating a professional portfolio as an opportunity to showcase yourself, your skills, your accomplishments and your work. You can use it as a portal to access your projects and difficult challenges you've overcome. The portfolio itself is going to be the first showcased project. You should seek to make it look professional, because as they say, <code>you only get one chance to make a first impression.</code> This professional portfolio is your chance.</p>
            <h4>Help getting started</h4>
            <p>The following articles have great instructions and some even have code examples/templates to help you create your portfolio. You may choose to start your portfolio from one of these templates if you find one you like, or you may start one from scratch if you'd rather. Both of these options have their pros and cons. But at the very least, you can use the links below to get some ideas of what you want to do and what you want your portfolio to look like. </p>
            <p>To finish up this course, we will get started on creating professional portfolios. We will create these using React, which will be a great opportunity to showcase your developing React skills. For your reference, <a href="nathanbirch.netlify.app" target="_blank">this</a> is the one that I made. Can you find which template I used below to make it?</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>The portfolio will probably take more than a few hours to create, which means you'll be working on it after this class has concluded. This is a good habit to get into, because your portfolio should always be kept up to date with your latest projects, skills, resume, and anything else that will help give you an edge in a competitive market. </p>
            <p>After you have your portfolio set up, it is a matter of working the details to fit you, what you've done, what your experience is, linking your projects in github, your resume, etc. Remember to have fun!!</p>
