        <h1>Assignment #1</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Today, you will complete your first assignment for this course. You will have an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the concepts taught in this module, and surely you will learn a lot as you develop a program of your own. These assignments are designed to be both fun and educational, as well as give you an opportunity to stretch yourself and develop your skills.</p>
        <p>Your tasks are as follows:</p>
        <h3>Before beginning this Task:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Download the following Zip file and extract it into a local folder of your choice:
                <a href="assignmentStart.zip">assignmentStart.zip</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Open the folder created by unzipping week03.zip in VS Code
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Getting values in HTML form control elements from JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            In last week's task, you accessed HTML elements and set their content and attributes using JavaScript.
            In this task, you are to retrieve data entered by the user from the HTML form elements they used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the same methods to access the HTML form elements that you used last week,
        <pre><code class="lang-js">document.getElementById('formElementId')</code></pre>
        <p>or</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-js">document.querySelector('#formElementId'),</code></pre>
        <p>to retrieve the value of a form control element, we use the <span class="file_name">value</span> property.</p>
        <p>For example, to get a value from the following HTML form control with an ID of <em>city</em>:</p>
        <p>
        <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;input type="text" id="city" name="city"&gt;</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>We would use the following syntax:</p>
        <p>
        <pre><code class="lang-js">let city = document.querySelector('#city').value</code></pre>
        </p>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <h4>Complete the following steps</h4>
        <p>In the <span class="file_name">task3.js</span> file:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Using function declaration, define a function named <em>add</em> that takes two arguments, <em>number1</em> and <em>number2</em></li>
            <li>In the function, return the sum of the parameters <em>number1</em> and <em>number2</em></li>
            <li>Using function declaration, define another function named <em>addNumbers</em> that gets the values of two HTML form controls with IDs of <em>addend1</em> and <em>addend2</em>. Pass them to the <em>sum</em> function</li>
            <li>Assign the return value to an HTML form element with an ID of <em>sum</em></li>
            <li>Add a "click" event listener to the HTML button with an ID of <em>addNumbers</em> that calls the <em>addNumbers</em> function</li>
            <li>Using function expressions, repeat Steps 1-5 with new functions named <em>subtract</em> and <em>subtractNumbers</em> and HTML form controls with IDs of <em>minuend</em>, <em>subtrahend</em>, <em>difference</em> and <em>subtractNumbers</em></li>
            <li>Using arrow functions, repeat Steps 1-5 with new functions named <em>multiply</em> and <em>mulitplyNumbers</em> and HTML form controls with IDs of <em>factor1</em>, <em>factor2</em>, <em>product</em> and <em>multiplyNumbers</em></li>
            <li>Using any of the three function declaration types, repeat Steps 1-5 with new functions named <em>divide</em> and <em>divideNumbers</em> and HTML form controls with IDs of <em>dividend</em>, <em>divisor</em>, <em>quotient</em> and <em>divideNumbers</em></li>
            <li>Test all of the mathematical functionality of the <span class="file_name">task3.html</span> page.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Built-In Methods</h3>
        <h4>Complete the following steps</h4>
        <p>In the <span class="file_name">task3.js</span> file:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Declare and instantiate a variable of type Date to hold the current date</li>
            <li>Declare a variable to hold the current year</li>
            <li>Using the variable declared in Step 1, call the built-in <em>getFullYear()</em> method/function and assign it to the variable declared in Step 2</li>
            <li>Assign the current year variable to an HTML form element with an ID of <em>year</em></li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Array Methods</h3>
        <h4>Complete the following steps</h4>
        <p>In the <span class="file_name">task3.js</span> file:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Declare and instantiate an array variable to hold the numbers 1 through 25</li>
            <li>Assign the value of the array variable to the HTML element with an ID of <em>array</em></li>
            <li>Use the <em>filter()</em> array method to find all of the odd numbers of the array variable and assign the reult to the HTML element with an ID of <em>odds</em> ( hint: % (modulus operartor) )</li>
            <li>Use the <em>filter()</em> array method to find all of the even numbers of the array variable and assign the result to the HTML element with an ID of <em>evens</em></li>
            <li>Use the <em>reduce()</em> array method to sum the array variable elements and assign the result to the HTML element with an ID of <em>sumOfArray</em></li>
            <li>Use the <em>map()</em> array method to multiple each element in the array variable by 2 and assign the result to the HTML element with an ID of <em>multiplied</em></li>
            <li>Use the <em>map()</em> and <em>reduce()</em> array methods to sum the array elements after multiplying each element by two. Assign the result to the HTML element with an ID of <em>sumOfMultiplied</em></li>
        </ol>
        <!-- <ul>
            <li><p>Write JavaScript code to perform mathematical operations on the sum of two numbers.</p></li>
            <li><p>Create a function called <code>operationOnSum</code> that takes 3 arguments, first number, second number, and the operation that is to be performed on their sum (this will be the callback function) .</p></li>
            <li><p>Create a function called <code> divideByHalf</code> and a function called <code> multiplyBy2</code> that are used as callback functions in the code above.</p></li>
            <li><p>These callback functions will be executed only after the function operationOnSum is executed.</p></li>
        </ul> -->
        <h3>Save/push changes to Github</h3>
        <p>Now that you have finished your program, it is time to save it in Github. We do this so that potential employers can see your work. It is good to be in the habit of saving your code in Github even in the very beginning. Anytime you write a program or work on a project, you will want to do what we are about to do now.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Open the terminal in VS code by right clicking the <code>JavaScript2</code> folder and selecting "Open in Integrated Terminal".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>execute the following commands:</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code>git status</code> - This will show what changes have been made in your repository.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code>git add .</code> - This will prepare all of your changes for a commit (which will be saved in version control if you ever need to view or return to the state that your code is currently in).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code>git commit -m "Lesson 2 assignment"</code> - This will save the changes that you just added with the name that you put for the message, in this case: "Lesson 2 Assignment".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code>git push</code> - This will save your code in Github. Now you could go to the github.com website and view your code their as well along with your commit.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Navigate to <a href="github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a> and verify that your repository shows your latest code.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Submit Assignment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/9u5h4kNVz81w8ChA8" target="_blank">This Form</a> to submit your assignment. You will need your github repository url (ie: https://github.com/yourUserName/JavaScript2) to complete this form.</p>
