        <h1>Computer Setup</h1>
        <p>Our goal today consists of setting up our computers so we can write, run and save our code. Here are our
            tasks:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Download VS Code (used to write code)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Download Google Chrome (used to run our code)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Download git (Used to manage our code)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a github account (Used to save our code and market ourselves)</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>If you took the JavaScript 1 course with Nathan Birch, you only have to do the following: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Create a new <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">github</a> repository called <code>javascript2</code>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use the git clone command to clone this repository on your computer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The following video goes through this process in detail and will help get you set up for the whole course.</p>
            </li>
            <li><iframe width="560" height="315" class="img-tutorial" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PvvaOwO4nKc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Complete Course Setup (VS Code, Chrome, Git, Github, etc.)</h2>
        <p>This video goes through the entire course setup, all of the installs and how to get things started along with a few extra tips on using git version control. (Anytime it says JavaScript1, use JavaScript2 because this is the JavaScript2 Course now).</p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" class="img-tutorial" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cHFsKOvpluc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h3>VS Code</h3>
        <p>To set up our computers to write JavaScript, all we need to do is download a text editor. We will be using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> also known as VS Code.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">this webpage</a> in your
                    browser.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Download VS Code for your operating system.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Install VS Code.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Accept all the default settings.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now that it is installed. Open VS Code. We are going to download two extensions. Click on the Extensions Icon
            and search <code>code runner</code>, then click install. Now search for <code>Live Server</code> and click
            install.</p>

        <img src="images/class1_10.png" class="img-tutorial" alt="">
        <p>Additionally, you may also watch the following media content that includes helpful tips and tricks to help
            you work efficiently with this program. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqCgcpAypFQ" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code Tutorial for
                        Beginners - Introduction (By Academind)</a></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can return to your files in VS code by clicking on the file explorer icon:</p>
        <img src="images/class1_11.png" class="img-tutorial" alt="">

        <h3>Google Chrome</h3>
        <p>You will not need Chrome to write JavaScript code, but we will need it to run the code. Just like if I have a
            movie file like avengers.mp4, I won't open it with Zoom...I will open it with a Media Player.</p>
        <p>You could technically use any browser to run the code, however, we will be using some tools built into Chrome
            to help us with our code.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">this webpage</a> in your
                    browser. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Download Chrome</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Install it</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>File Organization</h3>
        <p>This part of the tutorial does not require you to install anything, but you are encouraged to store all of
            your code in one place on your computer. This is important because eventually, your code will be used in
            what's called a <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-a-professional-portfolio-1987043" target="_blank">professional portfolio</a> to help you get a job. </p>
        <p>Create a folder on your computer for this class called <code>JavaScript2</code>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open VS Code. You should see something similar to this:</p>
                <br>
                <img src="images/class1_1.png" class="img-tutorial" alt="">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click "Open folder" (emphasized above) and select the folder your made for our class.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="images/class1_2.png" class="img-tutorial" alt="">
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Github Account</h3>
        <p>Lastly, we will use github to store all of our code. Github is used very widely in industry and we will also
            use it for your professional portfolio, to show to potential employers as you grow your skillset in web
            development. GitHub is essentially a big database of source code for people all around the world. You can make your source code public or private and configure many different permissions and settings. Each project has its own repository, or "repo". This repository will be a clone of the one on your local computer. Thus, you will have two copies of your code, one on your local computer and one at GitHub.</p>
        <h4>Install Git</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>If you haven't before, you'll need to and install git. If you already have git installed, <a href="#newRepo">skip this step</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Go to <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">git-scm.com</a> and choose the appropriate download for your operating system.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Run the installer with the default settings and wait for the installation to finish.</p>
            </li>
            <img src="images/git.png" alt="Run the git installer" class="img-tutorial">
            <li>
                <p>Restart VS Code if you have it open, and open a new terminal window by selecting New Terminal inside of the Terminal menu.</p>
            </li>
            <img class="img-tutorial" src="images/read3 copy.png" alt="Terminal > New terminal">
            <li>
                <p>In your terminal, execute <code>git --version</code>.</p>
            </li>
            <img src="images/git2.png" alt="git --version" class="img-tutorial">
            <li>
                <p>If "git --version" produces an error, make sure git has been <a href="https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/" target="_blank">added to your PATH environment variable</a>, then restart VS Code.</p>
                <div class="tips">
                    <p>Instructor Tip:</p>
                    <p>On Windows, Git is usually installed at <code>C:\Program Files\Git\cmd</code>. This is the location that should be added to your PATH.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="newRepo">Create a new repository</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Go to <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a> and sign up for a new account if you haven't already. If you already have an account, that is perfect, you can use it here.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After creating an account, return to GitHub.com and sign in. In the upper right corner of the screen you should see a "+" icon. Click this and select "New Repository".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose a name for your repository (likely javascript2 or something similar).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Leave the repo public and do not check the box for a readme. Leave .gitignore and license as "none".</p>
                <div class="tips">
                    <p>Instructor Tip:</p>
                    <p>It's not technically a problem if you add these other files now, but it makes it a little more difficult when you go to push to GitHub for the first time, because you'll have conflicts that you'll have to resolve. So at this point, it's easiest to leave everything blank.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the button to create the repository.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On the page that follows, you should see a URL for your new repository (e.g., "https://github.com/username/repositoryname.git"). Copy this URL for use later on.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Set up the repository on your computer</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In VS Code, selectOpen Folder from the File menu. Open the <code>JavaScript2</code> folder you just created.</p>
            </li>
            <img class="img-tutorial" src="images/read2 copy.png" alt="File > Open Folder">
            <li>
                <p>Open a new terminal window by selecting New Terminal inside of the Terminal menu.</p>
