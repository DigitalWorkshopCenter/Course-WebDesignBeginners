        <h1>Computer Setup</h1>
        <p>Our goal today consists of setting up our computers so we can write, run and save our code. Here are our
            tasks:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Download VS Code (used to write code)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Download Google Chrome (used to run our code)</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>VS Code & Chrome Setup</h2>
        <h3>VS Code</h3>
        <p>To set up our computers to write JavaScript, all we need to do is download a text editor. We will be using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> also known as VS Code.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">this webpage</a> in your
                    browser.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Download VS Code for your operating system.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Install VS Code.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Accept all the default settings.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now that it is installed. Open VS Code. We are going to download two extensions. Click on the Extensions Icon
            and search for <code>Live Server</code> and click
            install.</p>

        <p>Additionally, you may also watch the following media content that includes helpful tips and tricks to help
            you work efficiently with this program. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqCgcpAypFQ" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code Tutorial for
                        Beginners - Introduction (By Academind)</a></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can return to your files in VS code by clicking on the file explorer icon:</p>
        <img src="images/class1_11.png" class="img-tutorial" alt="">

        <h3>Google Chrome</h3>
        <p>You will not need Chrome to write JavaScript code, but we will need it to run the code. Just like if I have a
            movie file like avengers.mp4, I won't open it with Zoom...I will open it with a Media Player.</p>
        <p>You could technically use any browser to run the code, however, we will be using some tools built into Chrome
            to help us with our code.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">this webpage</a> in your
                    browser. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Download Chrome</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Install it</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>File Organization</h3>
        <p>This part of the tutorial does not require you to install anything, but you are encouraged to store all of
            your code in one place on your computer. This is important because eventually, your code will be used in
            what's called a <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-a-professional-portfolio-1987043" target="_blank">professional portfolio</a> to help you get a job. </p>
        <p>Create a folder on your computer for this class called <code>WebDevelopment</code>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open VS Code. You should see something similar to this:</p>
                <br>
                <img src="images/class1_1.png" class="img-tutorial" alt="">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click "Open folder" (emphasized above) and select the folder your made for our class.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="images/class1_2.png" class="img-tutorial" alt="">
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Congratulations! You have successfully set up everything that you will need for this course. If you had any issues, please contact your instructor. </p>
