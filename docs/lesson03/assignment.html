    <h1>Assignment #3</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Your assignment today is going to be awesome! All you have to do, is recreate this webpage by any means at your disposal (some helpful tools may be the Chrome developer tools (the elements, console and sources tabs) and the view page source button when you right click in the webpage).
    </p>
    <p>Your tasks are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Create an html file called <code>assignment3.html</code> and a css file called <code>assignment3.css</code>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Recreate the navbar. Retrieve the DWC image by right clicking on it and clicking save. The gradient in the text of the course title may be tricky, you can either inspect the element, or google how to do a gradient. It will also be tricky getting three distinct sections of the navbar. It may be helpful to do a google search for something like <code>navbar with three sections</code>. Notice that the navbar looks like this:
          <br>
          <img src="./images/assignment3_1.png" alt="" class="img-tutorial">
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Create the breadcrumb (be sure to include links to this website's pages).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Create the body content section with all the space on both sides. Again, it may be helpful to look inspect the code to see how much space is on each side and how it was done.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Now that you have a <code>div</code> for the body content, start with the <code>h1</code> tag at the top. Either inspecting the code to get the colors or using the Colorpick Eyedropper Chrome Extension will be very helpful.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Finish the assignment by recreating the rest of the page...again, using any means at your disposal. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Stretch Challenge</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Learn what Bootstrap is and use it in the navbar so that your navbar can collapse like the website can that you're working off of.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
