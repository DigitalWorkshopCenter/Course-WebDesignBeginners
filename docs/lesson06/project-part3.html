    <h1>Lab Project | Part III<br />One Awesome Website</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This course will have 3 labs (lessons 2, 4 and 6). Each lab will build on the previous lab, applying the concepts learned in other class sessions. For this first lab, we will finish the website and publish it for the world to see.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Clean up your website. If there is code that isn't being used, remove it. Make it so the code in VS Code looks nice.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Go through the list in the Project Overview Page that says: <code>EVERY PAGE SHOULD</code> and ensure that each page is good to go. The biggest aspect of this is likely the media queries to ensure that the pages look good on all devices.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Go through the list in the Project Overview Page that says: <code>THE PROJECT SHOULD</code> and make sure that the project is good to go. The only thing here you'll likely have to worry about is publishing your website. The <a href="./reading.html" target="_blank">Lesson 5 Reading</a> shows exactly how to publish your website.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Finally, submit your project. This time, all you'll have to do is submit the url to your live website. You can submit your project <a href="https://forms.gle/nEoFGY4cqpYxDjQC9" target="_blank">Here</a>. Be sure to submit this whether it is finished or not by the end of our Lesson 6 Class Session.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
