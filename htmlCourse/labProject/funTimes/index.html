                        <p>This was the first time we ever went camping as a family. It was pretty funny. I don't want to say that this little gif sums up the trip, because it really was delightful, but it was also very entertaining to go camping with such young children. ðŸ˜…</p>

                        <p>Several years ago on my birthday, my wife took me to a beautiful lake in St. George, UT and had us rent a jet ski. It was one of the most fun things that I've ever done, and it was so much fun to be out there with my wife. </p>

                        <p>My family was driving through Yellowstone Bear World, looking at so many beautiful animals. We were driving nice and slow next to this elk that was in the road when my 3 year-old daughter opened the window. Immediately, the three kids and wife by the window recoiled from the opening window while my wife told me to shut the window. Meanwhile, the elk lifted it's head and tried to reach into the vehicle. Haha it was a really funny experience. And we got the whole thing on video. ðŸ¤£ </p>

                        <p>Each Summer the Ramos family (my sister and her family) come and visit. Each year, we call this our Birmos vacation (get it? Birch/Ramos???). Anyways, it is pretty much my favorite time of the year. This is a picture of us playing a game called Lords of Waterdeep. It's always a blast. ðŸ¤“</p>
